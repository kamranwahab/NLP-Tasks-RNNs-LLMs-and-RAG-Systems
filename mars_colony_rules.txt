The Mars Colony was established in 2045 by the United Space Coalition.
All citizens must wear a biosuit when outside the domes between 18:00 and 06:00.
The currency used on Mars is the "Red Credit", which is pegged to 5.5 US Dollars.
Water rationing is in effect: each citizen is allowed 20 liters per day.
Violation of the water ration results in a fine of 500 Red Credits.
